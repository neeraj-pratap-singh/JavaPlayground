# Java Playground

Welcome to the Java Playground! This repository provides a platform for practicing Java programming and exploring various Java concepts. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this playground is designed to help you improve your Java skills and experiment with Java programs.

## Setup Instructions

To get started with the Java Playground, follow these steps to set up Java on your machine:

1. **Install Java Development Kit (JDK):** Download and install the latest version of JDK for your operating system. JDK can be downloaded from the official Oracle website or other trusted sources.

2. **Configure Java Environment Variables:** After installing JDK, configure the Java environment variables on your system. Add the JDK bin directory to the `PATH` environment variable, so that you can run Java commands from the command line.

3. **Verify Java Installation:** Open a terminal or command prompt and type `java -version`. This command should display the installed Java version. Additionally, running `javac -version` should display the version of the Java compiler.

4. **Install Java IDE or Editor:** Choose a Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or a text editor to write and run your Java programs. One popular option is Visual Studio Code (VS Code), which provides great support for Java programming through various extensions.

5. **Install Java Extension for VS Code:** If you have chosen VS Code as your Java development environment, install the "Java Extension Pack" from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace. This extension pack includes essential extensions for Java development, such as language support, debugger, and build tools.

## Usage

Once you have set up Java and your preferred Java development environment, you can start exploring and practicing Java in the Java Playground. Here are a few steps to guide you:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Start by cloning this repository to your local machine using Git. Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/neeraj-pratap-singh/JavaPlayground.git
   ```

2. **Open the Project:** Open the cloned project in your Java IDE or text editor. If you're using VS Code, open the project folder from the "File" menu or by running `code java-playground` in the terminal.

3. **Explore the Examples:** The repository contains various directories and files that represent different Java topics and examples. Navigate through the directories to find specific examples or create your own Java files for experimentation.

4. **Run Java Programs:** To run a Java program, open the desired Java file in your IDE or editor and use the built-in run command or shortcut. Alternatively, you can use the command line to compile and run Java programs using `javac` and `java` commands.

5. **Experiment and Learn:** Feel free to modify the existing examples or create new Java programs to experiment with different concepts and features of the Java language. Use the playground to practice coding, understand Java syntax, and explore Java libraries and frameworks.
